    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",

    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).

    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** <br><br>\n",
    "**Description of the built CNN-RNN architecture in detail:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CNN Encoder:**\n",
    "    - `Transfer Learning used` in this project where we have considered the `ResNet50 architecture`.\n",
    "    - `ResNet50` is a `pre-trained` version of the network trained on more than a million images from the ImageNet database.\n",
    "    - This `ResNet50 architecture (with the final fully-connected layer removed)` is `used in the encoder` to `extract the features` from the batch of pre-processed images.\n",
    "    - `The output is then flattened to a vector, before being passed through a Linear layer (fully-connected layer at the end)` to `transform the feature vector to have the same size as the word embeddings.`<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **RNN Decoder:**\n",
    "    - `Consists of 1 embedding layer` to `transform the input image features and captions into embeddings`. \n",
    "    - `LSTM takes LSTM inputs as a torch tensor obtained after concatenating features and embedded captions`, so that the model can find relationships between word tokens better.\n",
    "    - `Consists of 1 LSTM layer (num_layers= 1)` with a possibility to extend the number of LSTM layers and add the dropout layers between them. For the mentioned architecture, the `default dropout is set to 0 (i.e. no dropout)`, as it seems to perform well with the mentioned configuration.\n",
    "    - `Finally, 1 fully-connected linear layer to generate outputs.`.<br><br>\n",
    "    - A `sample function is written` to `transform the outputs generated into the vocabulary keys`.<br><br>\n",
    "     **Sample Function (within Decoder):**<br>\n",
    "     - `Embedded features of an image (output of encoder)` is `passed through the decoder sample function`. This sample function uses LSTM to generate outputs in the form of a list of predicted word token indices of subsequent words until the end of the caption or max caption length is reached. \n",
    "     - `Reverse mapping of the predicted indices of these word tokens is done to retrieve the words` (using clean_sentence() function - 3_Inference.ipynb) and `then the corresponding clean sentence caption is generated`.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Selecting the values of variables (including hyperparameters) in Task 1, and the reasons behind selections:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **batch_size** - `Batch size is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step.` The batch size of each training batch was changed and `iterated for a small number of steps within epoch with varying sizes as 32, 64, 128 and 256.` For the current model architecture, `the batch size of 128 was selected based on the following reasons`:<br><br>\n",
    "    - `A batch size not too large but at the same time not too small.` It should be `able to generalize the model better`. \n",
    "    - Slightly larger batch_size: `Helps it train the model faster on GPU`. \n",
    "    - The model has thousands of images in the training data, so `we can afford to use a batch_size of 128 which gives us a decent number of backpropagation steps to update model weights and thereby deliver better performance over epochs`.<br><br>\n",
    "- **vocab_threshold** - `The minimum word count threshold was chosen to be 4, because this seemed to be a reasonable size for the vocabulary`. Moreover, the rare words were even quite rarer in their unique appearances; resulting in not a vast increase in vocabulary. Hence, the choice.<br><br>    \n",
    "- **vocab_from_file** - `A Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from a file.` `Based on the new vocab_threshold, a new vocabulary will be generated. Hence, vocab_from_file was set to False in order to generate new vocabulary`.<br><br>\n",
    "- **embed_size** - `The dimensionality of the image and word embeddings was chosen to be 500` as for some studied architectures, 300-500 seemed to be an ideal size.<br><br>\n",
    "- **hidden_size** - `The number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder was chosen to be 512`. This is because we want the LSTM to include the nuances in the flow of subsequent word token predictions and at the same time, it shouldn't be too large to overfit the model. <br><br>\n",
    "- **num_epochs** - `Have taken the recommended number of epochs into account while training the model (num_epochs= 3)`. On evaluating the performance of the model, and on the basis of availability of GPU resources, it was deduced that these many epochs were sufficient for a decent performance. <br><br>\n",
    "- **save_every** - Determines how often to save the model weights. Set `save_every=1, to save the model weights after each epoch`. This way, after the ith epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the models/ folder as encoder-i.pkl and decoder-i.pkl, respectively.<br><br>\n",
    "- **print_every** - Determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training. Chosen value of `print_every =100 (default- recommended)`.<br><br>\n",
    "- **log_file** - The name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training. File log can be found in the `\"training_log.txt\"` file within the directory.<br><br>\n",

    "**Reasons why these train transforms are a good choice for the mentioned architecture:**\n",

But it should be noted that in PyTorch, 'on the fly' transforms are applied on each item in the dataset one by one and not adding to the size of the dataset.` <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, data augmentation transforms (e.g. RandomHorizontalFlip) are actually applied on each item in the dataset one by one (randomly based on the probability) and not adding to the size of the dataset, thereby not augmenting the size of the dataset. `Although there is work-around to augment the data, by default, in PyTorch 'on the fly' transforms operations are applied to the original images at every batch generation. Meaning, the dataset is left unchanged, only a batch of images are copied and transformed every iteration when we perform these 'on the fly' transforms.` <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Also, there is no need to augment the data (additional transformed images concatenated to the existing dataset) by increasing the size of the original dataset`. This is `because` <br>\n",

    "`(ii) such augmentation might lead to increased size of dataset, thereby leading to increased training time`.<br><br>\n",

    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",

    "**Answer:** <br><br>\n",
    "**Selecting the trainable parameters in CNN-RNN architecture, and reasons for their selection:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **In Encoder:**<br>\n",
    "    - Since we are using Transfer Learning in the encoder, `the parameters of all the layers except the last embedding layer are frozen to avoid training of these pre-trained parameters of the ResNet50 architecture`. \n",
    "    - **Only updated the parameters of the embedding layer (embed) in the encoder**. Thus, setting the training and update of parameters of all the other layers to False, making only the last embed layer trainable. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **In Decoder:**<br>\n",
    "    - **All the decoder parameters are set to trainable** because `the decoder has a relatively low number of parameters`, which are necessary to be trained. \n",

    "For this project, you need not worry about overfitting. **This project does not have strict requirements regarding the performance of your model**, and you just need to demonstrate that your model has learned **_something_** when you generate captions on the test data.  For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, if you would like to go above and beyond in this project, you can read about some approaches to minimizing overfitting in section 4.3.1 of [this paper](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7505636).  In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
